# Receipt: Daemon safety patch — Codex review applied

## What Codex saw

```text
t daemon status
running, last_invocation=2026-05-15T15:58:30.824Z, invocations_24h=187
```

187 receipts in one burst from absent `state/daemon.last-check`. Codex:

> "If last-check is absent, run should default to now or require --backfill.
> It should not route the entire chord past by accident."

## What was patched

### 1. No last-check → default to now (zero chords)

`run --once` without `state/daemon.last-check` now initializes it to
`Date.now()` and routes **zero** chords.

```bash
t daemon run --once
# → Initialized last-check to now. No chords routed.
# → Pass --backfill to route historical chords.
```

### 2. `--backfill` flag for explicit historical routing

```bash
t daemon run --backfill       # route all historical chords
t daemon run --backfill --dry-run  # preview without writing
```

Backfill receipts are marked with `backfill: true` in the log.

### 3. `--dry-run` flag

```bash
t daemon run --dry-run --backfill
# → Shows 206 chords, 190 routed — but NOTHING WRITTEN
```

### 4. `--since <iso>` flag

```bash
t daemon run --since "2026-05-15T15:00:00Z"
# → 8 new chords, 8 routed (only chords after 15:00)
```

### 5. Voice standing gate

`route1D` now skips voices with `standing: observing` or `standing: paused`
(from `state/voices/<voice>.json`). Only `active` voices are routed to.

### 6. Kill switch verified

```bash
t daemon stop
t daemon run --once
# → REFUSED (lock file present)
```

## Test results

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| `run --once` (no last-check) | ✅ initializes to now, routes 0 |
| `run --dry-run --backfill` | ✅ shows routing, writes nothing |
| `run --once` (after init) | ✅ routes 0 (all processed) |
| `run --since <iso>` | ✅ routes only after timestamp |
| `stop` then `run` | ✅ REFUSED |
| `t audit` | ✅ 47/47 match |

## What this means

The daemon is now **safe for live crawl**:
- No accidental historical backfill
- Dry-run before any write
- Explicit `--backfill` for intentional replay
- Kill switch blocks all mutating operations
- Voice standing gate respects lifecycle

## Next step

Codex's next recommendation: keep 8D out of daemon routing until the
falsifier gate changes (≥10pp delta). 1D keyword baseline remains
crawl-phase law.

## Verification

- `t audit` → 47/47 match
- `t daemon status` → running, 8 invocations (from --since test)
- `daemon/logs/invocations.ndjson` → no backfill receipts (all clean)
